# Employment-Outcomes-Based-on-College-Majors
In this project, we'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college from 2010 through 2012. The original data was released by the American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

Rank - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
Major_code - Major code.
Major - Major description.
Major_category - Category of major.
Total - Total number of people with major.
Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
Men - Male graduates.
Women - Female graduates.
ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
Employed - Number employed.
Median - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
Low_wage_jobs - Number in low-wage service jobs.
Full_time - Number employed 35 hours or more.
Part_time - Number employed less than 35 hours.
We want to explore the dataset and answer questions like:

Do students in more popular majors make more money?
What does the unemployment rate look like across the sample size?
Which majors have the highest percentage of women?
